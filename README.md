## Welcome to my space üëã

This is my part of GitHub where I share and work on most of my software development.

### Collaboration

I am looking for people who are keen to collaborate on the Go toolkit and GUI capabilities for Python in general.

### Sponsorship

As I am an independent, unpaid, open source developer I rely on the generosity of my sponsors to pay the bills.
If you like my work please consider [sponsoring me](https://github.com/sponsors/LeelooR).

Thank you so much ‚ù§Ô∏è!
